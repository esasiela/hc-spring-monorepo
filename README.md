# HedgeCourt Spring Monorepo

This is the base project for HedgeCourt Spring Boot API development.

This monorepo has two children:

1. `hc-spring-lib` - common classes for HC Spring Boot API services.
2. `hc-auth-api` - the implementation of HC Auth API, also serving as the reference for other HC
   services.

The project is also a test bed for GitHub actions.
